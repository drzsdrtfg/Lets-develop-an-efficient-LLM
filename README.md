# Lets-develop-an-efficient-LLM
The goal of this repository is to build an efficient LLM based on Andrej Karpathys "build-nanogpt" (repo: https://github.com/karpathy/build-nanogpt). Ensure to try staying at one file (see train_gpt2.py) and ask me for compute resources. I can rent H100, A100 A40, RTX4090 ... GPUs for a short time (few hours) depending on the importance.
